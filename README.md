(_Still in production_)
### _Introduction_
When trying to learn about new topics in software engineering I always would be visiting a bunch of the same sites. Hacker News to find some good blog posts/articles on the subject, Github to see some projects, and Stack Overflow to see some small examples. Conveniently, all of these services have an API that I have taken advantage of (still looking to add more sites). The application is a simple flask web service that serves an html page with a search bar, and that search posts a JSON request to the server which does the API calls.
